/// This is a batch application that manages the execution of arbitrarily defined jobs
/// with own lifecycle.
///
/// In order to run this batch application, you first need to create at least
/// one [Job] object. After creating the Job object, use the [addJob] method to register
/// the Job to the batch application.
///
/// [Job] represents the maximum unit of a certain processing system
/// that consists of multiple steps. In addition, a Step consists of multiple Tasks. Step
/// is an intermediate concept between Job and Task, and Task is the specific
/// minimum unit of processing in a particular processing system.
///
/// You can use [addSharedParameter] to add a value that will be shared by the
/// entire this batch application. This value can be added by tying it to string key and
/// can be used in the Task class throughout the execution context.
///
/// Also you can get more information about implementation on [example page](https://github.com/myConsciousness/batch.dart/blob/main/example/example.dart).
///
/// These job configuration can be assembled in any way you like. For example,
/// you can configure it as follows.
///
/// ```
/// BatchApplication

/// â”‚              â”Œ Task1
